      "text/plain": "'Hello. I don\\'t really know how to start this. I guess I\\'ll tell you how I met my ex.\\n\\nRoughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I\\'ve struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn\\'t seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her \"previous life\" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn\\'t working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.\\n\\nThings were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she\\'d lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won\\'t say that it wasn\\'t somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She\\'d have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.\\n\\nAfter a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn\\'t let her. The drinking got worse. I\\'d come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we\\'d argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I\\'d be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.\\n\\nOne night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn\\'t give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn\\'t hear my music. I couldn\\'t believe it, I just couldn\\'t. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don\\'t want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.\\n\\nI tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents\\' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn\\'t want to talk to me. \\n\\nOne week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn\\'t care. How it had been the last straw.\\n\\nI feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I\\'ve been sober for 5 months now, but it\\'s not enough. It\\'s never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I\\'ve been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can\\'t.\\n\\nThanks for reading to the end.'"

      "No less disquieting than the first book, this second volume picks up where the last one ended: right after Merq shot the Premiere of Singapore, leader of the Opposition. As a consequence, the Borders War flares up again, those who fight for individual freedom have new hope, and Merq is now the \"face of the Revolution\", suddenly well-known and officially reports to the president. Armise has become \"the traitor\", since he saved Merq's life, but is quite happy to be with Merq. The real differences between these two men is at the center of this book: what they know, how they react, and how they figure out what's next becomes far more important than whether or not they have a relationship and what they may want out of it. \n",
      " Merq is still a soldier, but the sudden absence of a clear mission in the aftermath of his successfully assassinating the leader of the Opposition is hard on him. He knows following orders is easy, and he has no problem with any of them. But he discovers that it matters a great deal to him who gives them to him. Blind obedience is no longer an option. Merq now has a loyalty he never had to deal with before: Armise. He doesn't admit it, but it affects his actions. The fact that Armise openly admits he wants to stay with Merq only makes it more difficult for Merq to deny that he actually does have feelings for the man. His \"solution\" is to word it slightly differently, making their relationship about trust. Which is as true as anything else, I guess, since the political maneuvering only intensifies, and the question of how to win this war is as dependent on military power as it is on Merq and Armise's new mission: kill all members of the Opposition council. \n",
      " Armise remains as interesting a conundrum as he was in the first book. And since Merq tells the story, I have no idea what goes on in Armise's head. Interestingly, his external loyalty, for the time being, is clearly with Merq. Armise has switched sides in the war, and supports what Merq does, working with him to fulfill their assassination mission. But other information about his past emerges , and it makes it much less clear who he really is. Genetic modification will mess with anyone's self-image, as well as, potentially, with their fundamental loyalties. I had no doubts that he will do anything to protect Merq, but as for the bigger picture and how he fits in? That remains to be seen. \n",
      " As in the first book, loyalties are fierce, and the battle lines clearly drawn. Thanks to some additional information about some of the five remaining powers on Earth in this version of the 26th century, it became a little clearer to me whose morals were closer to something I could support, and whose were not. However, since all sides have been involved in 300 years of war, I still have trouble siding with any one of them. I think this is fascinating, and puts me right into the same spot as Merq: the instinctive tendency is to side with the party he is fighting for, the Revolution, but there are too many questions about their methods for me to be completely certain I want them to win. So, I ended up with Armise: I am siding wit Merq, and can't wait to see what else he learns as he begins to question the stories he has always been told by the political leaders of \"his side\". \n",
      " If you don't like books about war, extreme violence, and torture, stay away from this one. If you're curious to find out what might happen to humanity in a future where fighting for dominance with weapons has become a reality again, this is an increasingly fascinating look at what might happen. If you're wondering about the power of propaganda and how someone who grew up believing what he was told might begin to question the truth of it all, this is the right series for you. This second story is moving, brutally honest, and very powerful. I suspect it will grab your attention and not let go once you start reading - it certainly held me in its clutches from beginning to end! \n",

I think this is fascinating, and puts me right into the same spot as Merq: the instinctive tendency is to side with the party he is fighting for, the Revolution, but there are too many questions about their methods for me to be completely certain I want them to win. So, I ended up with Armise: I am siding wit Merq, and can't wait to see what else he learns as he begins to question the stories he has always been told by the political leaders of \"his side\". If you don't like books about war, extreme violence, and torture, stay away from this one. If you're curious to find out what might happen to humanity in a future where fighting for dominance with weapons has become a reality again, this is an increasingly fascinating look at what might happen. If you're wondering about the power of propaganda and how someone who grew up believing what he was told might begin to question the truth of it all, this is the right series for you. This second story is moving, brutally honest, and very powerful. I suspect it will grab your attention and not let go once you start reading - it certainly held me in its clutches from beginning to end!

      "text/plain": "\"Kampung Boy (Budak Kampung) is an autobiography in the form of a graphic novel. It covers Lat's childhood in the 1950s and 1960s in a village in the Kinta Valley. It starts with his birth and ends with his father riding with him to the boarding school as a teen. I found this book tucked between a number of manga series at my local library. I was drawn in by the title and the publisher / importer: :01 (same publisher as Life Sucks). I flipped through the book, liked the art style and found the first few pages captivating. [SNIPPET]  Stylistically Kampung Boy reminds me most of Three Shadows by Cyril Pedrosa (another :01 import) (). There's a similarity with the jutting jaws, wiggly legs and the basic energy of all the characters (especially the children). What's thankfully missing from Kampung Boy is the underlying tragedy of Three Shadows. Besides being a fun coming of age story, Kampung Boy was educational for me. I went into the book knowing next to nothing about Malaysia. I came away with a better feeling for some of the country's culture and a desire to learn more. The sequel to Kampung Boy is called Town Boy. I hope to find a copy to read.\""
